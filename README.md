# RealTimeFDTD
Starting point for lecture on real-time FDTD in JUCE.

The code was generated by the Projucer (v6.1.6) based on the Audio Application template. I changed the following things in the Projucer settings:

1. Added the OneDWave component:
    - Right click in the Projucer's File Explorer
    - Select 'Add New Component Class (split between a CPP & header)...'
    
2. Added Visual Studio Exporters (2019 and 2022) so that you Windows users can also open the project in your IDE :)

3. In the settings (gear icon), changed 'Add "using namespace juce" to JuceHeader.h' to 'Enabled'.


The changes in the MainComponent.h/.cpp files are marked by:

 ///__________________________
 
 ...
 
 ///__________________________

The rest is generated by the template.
